Churn Prediction for Subscription Services: Improving Customer Retention
This project focuses on churn prediction in a fictional business context. Churn, in this context, refers to the scenario where customers discontinue their subscription or service. Predicting and understanding churn is vital for businesses to retain customers and sustain growth. This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the project.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a churn prediction model that can identify customers at risk of churning. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide insights into customer behavior and factors influencing churn. Additionally, actionable recommendations will be made to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies.

Data
The dataset used in this project is a synthetic dataset, representing a fictitious business. It includes the following columns:

CustomerID: A unique customer identifier.
SubscriptionDuration: The duration of a customer's subscription in months.
PaymentFrequency: The frequency of payments (e.g., monthly, annually).
UsageFrequency: The frequency of product usage (e.g., daily, weekly).
CustomerSupportInteractions: The number of customer support interactions.
Churn: A binary label (1 for churned, 0 for retained).
Data Analysis
Data Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA include visualizations of subscription duration, correlation matrices, pairplots, and boxplots for different features. These visualizations help in understanding the data and relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming features to improve model performance. This step is crucial for developing an effective churn prediction model.

Model Building
A Random Forest classifier was selected as the churn prediction model. The model was trained on the training dataset to predict customer churn based on various features.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance was assessed using common classification metrics, which are as follows:

Accuracy: 0.77
Precision: 0.22
Recall: 0.07
F1 Score: 0.10
ROC AUC: 0.50
These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. While accuracy is relatively high, the low precision, recall, and F1 score suggest that the model may have difficulty correctly identifying churned customers. The ROC AUC value of 0.50 indicates that the model's predictive power is no better than random chance.

Results
The churn prediction model's results suggest that the model's performance is limited in accurately predicting customer churn. Key factors contributing to churn were not identified effectively, and the model's ability to make reliable predictions is questionable.

In light of these results, it is essential to further refine the model, explore more advanced machine learning techniques, or consider the inclusion of additional data sources to enhance the predictive power and accuracy of the model.

Actionable recommendations for reducing churn should be approached with caution given the current limitations of the model. A more robust model is needed to provide reliable insights and strategies for customer retention.
